# Change: Add Blog Post - 4 Essential Slash Commands for Development Workflow

## Why

The claude-howto project provides excellent reference documentation but lacks blog-style content that showcases real-world usage patterns. Users have found 4 slash commands particularly valuable across their development workflow, and a blog post explaining when/where/how to use each would help others adopt these productivity tools.

## What Changes

- Create new `blog-post/` directory for blog content
- Add blog post: "4 Essential Slash Commands I Use in Every Project"
- Cover 4 commands with practical guidance:
  - `/push-all` - Quick deployment of coherent changes
  - `/setup-ci-cd` - Post-POC quality infrastructure
  - `/doc-refactor` - Post-MVP documentation polish
  - `/unit-test-expand` - Milestone-driven test expansion
- Reference the first slash commands blog: [Discovering Claude Code Slash Commands](https://medium.com/@luongnv89/discovering-claude-code-slash-commands-cdc17f0dfb29)
- Link to full command files when content exceeds 30 lines

## Impact

- Affected specs: None (new capability)
- Affected code: New `blog-post/` directory and content
- No breaking changes
