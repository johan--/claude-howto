# Change: Update Slash Commands README with New Commands

## Why

The `01-slash-commands/README.md` is outdated and needs to reflect:
1. Updated `push-all.md` command with enhanced safety checks (API key validation, confirmation workflow)
2. Three new slash commands added to the folder: `doc-refactor.md`, `setup-ci-cd.md`, `unit-test-expand.md`

## What Changes

- **Update push-all documentation**: Reflect the enhanced workflow including safety checks, API key validation, and confirmation prompts
- **Add doc-refactor command**: Document the new documentation restructuring command
- **Add setup-ci-cd command**: Document the new CI/CD pipeline setup command
- **Add unit-test-expand command**: Document the new test coverage expansion command
- Update "Available Commands" section count from 4 to 7 commands

## Impact

- Affected specs: `slash-commands`
- Affected code: `01-slash-commands/README.md`
