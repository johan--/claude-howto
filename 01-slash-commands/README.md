# Slash Commands

## Overview

Slash commands are tools that control Claude's behavior during an interactive session. They enable teams to standardize frequently-used prompts and workflows, and come in several types with different capabilities.

## Types of Slash Commands

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Built-in** | Commands provided by Claude Code | `/help`, `/clear`, `/model` |
| **Custom** | User-defined Markdown files | `/optimize`, `/pr` |

## Custom Slash Commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute.

### File Locations

| Location | Scope | Label in `/help` | Use Case |
|----------|-------|------------------|----------|
| `.claude/commands/` | Project-specific | `(project)` | Team workflows, shared standards |
| `~/.claude/commands/` | Personal | `(user)` | Personal shortcuts across projects |

**Priority:** Project commands take precedence over personal commands with the same name.

### Namespacing with Subdirectories

Use subdirectories to group related commands:

```
.claude/commands/
├── frontend/
│   └── component.md    → /component (project:frontend)
├── deploy/
│   ├── production.md   → /production (project:deploy)
│   └── staging.md      → /staging (project:deploy)
└── optimize.md         → /optimize (project)
```

### Arguments

Commands can receive arguments in two ways:

**All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`:**

```markdown
# .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards
```

Usage: `/fix-issue 123 high-priority` → `$ARGUMENTS` becomes "123 high-priority"

**Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.:**

```markdown
# .claude/commands/review-pr.md
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3
```

Usage: `/review-pr 456 high alice` → `$1`="456", `$2`="high", `$3`="alice"

### Bash Command Execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

### File References

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

### Thinking Mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including extended thinking keywords in the command content.

## Frontmatter

Command files support YAML frontmatter for configuration:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `allowed-tools` | List of tools the command can use | Inherits from conversation |
| `argument-hint` | Expected arguments for auto-completion | None |
| `description` | Brief description of the command | Uses first line from prompt |
| `model` | Specific model to use | Inherits from conversation |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Prevent SlashCommand tool from calling this | `false` |

## Plugin Commands

Plugins can provide custom slash commands that integrate with Claude Code:

```
/plugin-name:command-name
```

Or simply `/command-name` when there are no naming conflicts.

**Examples:**
```bash
/frontend-design:frontend-design
/commit-commands:commit
/code-review:code-review
```

## MCP Slash Commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/mcp__github__list_prs
/mcp__github__pr_review 456
/mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

## SlashCommand Tool

Claude can programmatically invoke custom slash commands using the SlashCommand tool.

### Enabling Programmatic Invocation

Reference the command in your prompt or `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

### Disabling for Specific Commands

Use the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter field:

```markdown
---
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

Or disable via permissions:
```
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: SlashCommand
```

### Character Budget

- **Default limit:** 15,000 characters
- **Custom limit:** Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable

## Skills vs Slash Commands

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Skills |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Best for** | Quick, frequently used prompts | Comprehensive capabilities with structure |
| **Files** | Single `.md` file | Directory with `SKILL.md` + resources |
| **Invocation** | Explicit (`/command`) | Automatic (context-based) |
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts | Complex workflows with multiple steps |

**Use slash commands** when you invoke the same prompt repeatedly and it fits in a single file.

**Use skills** when Claude should discover the capability automatically or multiple files/scripts are needed.

## Installation

### For Project-wide Use (Team)

Copy these files to your project's `.claude/commands/` directory:

```bash
# Create commands directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Copy command files
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md .claude/commands/
```

### For Personal Use

Copy to your personal Claude commands directory:

```bash
# Create personal commands directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# Copy command files
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Creating Your Own Commands

### Basic Command Template

Create a file `.claude/commands/my-command.md`:

```markdown
---
description: What this command does
argument-hint: [optional-args]
---

# Command Title

Instructions for Claude:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

Output format:
- How to format the response
- What to include
```

### Command with Full Frontmatter

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(npm test:*), Bash(npm run lint:*)
argument-hint: [--verbose] [--coverage]
description: Run tests with optional coverage report
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

# Test Runner

Run the project tests with the following options:
- Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Package.json scripts: @package.json

## Steps
1. Run `npm test`
2. If --coverage flag provided, generate coverage report
3. Summarize results and highlight any failures
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|------|---------|
| Use clear, action-oriented names | Create commands for one-time tasks |
| Include `description` in frontmatter | Build complex logic in commands |
| Keep commands focused on single task | Create redundant commands |
| Version control project commands | Hardcode sensitive information |
| Organize in subdirectories | Create long lists of commands |
| Use `$ARGUMENTS` or `$1`, `$2` for dynamic input | Use abbreviated or cryptic wording |
| Use `!` prefix for dynamic context | Assume Claude knows current state |

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Problem:** Claude doesn't recognize `/my-command`

**Solutions:**
- Check file is in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Verify filename matches command name
- Restart Claude Code session
- Check file has `.md` extension

### Command Not Executing as Expected

**Problem:** Command loads but doesn't work correctly

**Solutions:**
- Review command prompt clarity
- Add more specific instructions
- Include examples in command file
- Test with simple inputs first
- Check `allowed-tools` if using bash commands

### Personal vs Project Commands

**When to use personal commands:**
- Personal preferences/workflows
- Not relevant to team
- Experimental commands
- Cross-project shortcuts

**When to use project commands:**
- Team standards
- Project-specific workflows
- Shared conventions
- Onboarding helpers
