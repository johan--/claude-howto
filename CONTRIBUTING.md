## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto.git
cd claude-howto
```

### 2. Create a Branch
Use a descriptive branch name:
```bash
git checkout -b add/feature-name
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
git checkout -b docs/improvement-area
```

### 3. Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
